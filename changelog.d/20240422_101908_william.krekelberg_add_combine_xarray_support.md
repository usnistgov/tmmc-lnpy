### Removed

- A bullet item for the Removed category.

### Added

- Added `concat_windows` method to handle concatenating objects from multiple
  windows. This replaces being able to pass Iterables of objects to combine
  routines.

### Changed

- Renamed `combine_shifted_lnpy` to `shift_lnpi_windows`
- Renamed `combine_dropfirst` to `keep_first`. This is in keeping with
  `drop_duplicates` from pandas, where `keep='first'` implies keeping the first
  occurrence of a value and dropping later values. This is effectively what that
  routine does.
- `shift_lnpi_windows` and `keep_first` now only accept accept an object instead
  of an iterable of objects. This simplifies the code and typing. To pass in
  iterables of objects, first use `concat_windows`.
